## Overview

ThemeDeck lets you add and manage custom music across your Steam library and key Steam UI pages.

<a href="https://discord.gg/Smh4K5Ad">For support, suggestions, etc. please visit my Discord</a>.

## Install Package

1. Go to https://github.com/BrenticusMaximus/ThemeDeck/releases/ and download the latest ZIP, not the source code.

2. Put it anywhere on your steam deck where you'll be able to find it later.

3. On steam deck, go to decky settings, general, enable developer mode.

4. On steam deck, go to decky settings, developer, 'install plugin from zip file', and find the zip from step 2. 

## YouTube setup

Use **Install YouTube support** (or **Update YouTube support**) inside ThemeDeck. ThemeDeck installs `yt-dlp` with its recommended dependencies and installs a private Deno runtime when a supported Deno executable is not already available.

ThemeDeck uses Firefox cookies for YouTube previews and downloads. Sign in to YouTube in Firefox on the Steam Deck before using those actions. ThemeDeck passes this configuration directly to yt-dlp and does not replace your global yt-dlp configuration file.

## Release Updates

## June 30, 2026 Update (v3.0.1)

- Fixed bulk auto-assign library detection when Steam's frontend library cache reports zero games.
- Added a backend Steam library scan so "all games", "installed games", "uninstalled games", and "games without music" use the Deck's actual Steam library files.

## June 29, 2026 Update (v3.0.0)

- Added controller-first navigation for assigning music from the "Choose ThemeDeck music..." screen.
- You can now use the D-pad plus A/B buttons to search YouTube, preview tracks, download and assign tracks, and browse local files while docked or using an external controller.
- Controller controls for YouTube results:
  - D-pad left/right moves between YouTube search results.
  - D-pad up/down switches between **Play Preview** and **Download & Assign** inside the current result.
  - Press A on **Play Preview** to start or stop a preview.
  - Press A on **Download & Assign** to download that result and assign it to the current game.
  - Press B to go back.
  - From the first result, D-pad left returns to the search controls.
  - From the last result, D-pad right moves down to **Or, browse local files**.
- Improved YouTube search handling for game names with special characters, including trademark symbols.
- Added local cached previews so YouTube preview playback works more reliably in Gaming Mode.
- Added clearer **Currently assigned** highlighting when a YouTube search result matches the track already assigned to the game.
- Added extra ThemeDeck debug logging at `/home/deck/ThemeDeck/themedeck-debug.log`.

## April 27, 2026 Update (v2.6.0)

- Added a ThemeDeck master volume override at the bottom of settings.
- At 100%, ThemeDeck respects each game/global/store track volume; below 100%, all ThemeDeck music plays at the selected master level.

## April 21, 2026 Update (v2.5.5)

- Added a "Now Playing" overlay card that shows the current track and source context.
- Added a real audio-reactive visualizer tied to the active music playback.
- Improved visualizer reliability across game-to-game navigation by rebuilding audio analysis when track sources change.

## March 3, 2026 Update (v2.5.4)

This update includes UI and playback behavior improvements:

- Moved per-game controls (Volume, Start skip, Loop track) from the long main settings list into each game page.
- Added a per-game Play/Pause preview button beside Remove music on each game page.
- Fixed playback precedence on game pages: assigned game music now takes priority; if a game has no assigned track, global ambient continues.
- Fixed context-menu behavior so pressing Start on a game from home/library no longer starts that game music outside the full game page.

## February 28, 2026 Update (v2.5.3)

- Improved playback stability so global/ambient audio no longer conflicts with per-game playback during navigation/launch transitions.
- Added per-track loop control for game, global, and store tracks so each assignment can loop or play once.

## February 27, 2026 Update (v2.5.2)

- Added finer control for when game music stops: launch start or launch finish.
- Added a dedicated store-track enable/disable control.

## February 25, 2026 Update (v2.5.1)

- Fixed a critical launch-state issue so ThemeDeck does not play global/ambient or game-page music while a game is running.

## February 25, 2026 Update (v2.5.0)

- Added bulk auto-assign for games without music.
- Added a "Show games without music" list with live name-resolution progress.
- Improved game ID handling to reduce duplicate/alias entries.

## February 25, 2026 Update (v2.4.2)

- Prevented global/ambient auto-play inside ThemeDeck assignment pages, so global music does not play while selecting or assigning per-game tracks.

## February 24, 2026 Update (v2.4.1)

- Ensured ThemeDeck does not play any music tracks while Steam is in Desktop Mode.

## February 24, 2026 Update (v2.4.0)

- Included separate volume and playback controls for the ambient track.

## February 21, 2026 Update (v2.2.0)

## February 21, 2026 Update (v2.1.0)
